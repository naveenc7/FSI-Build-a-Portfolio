      Directions:
        1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content
        2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text
        3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text "Software Developer"
        4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag which will make a horizontal line
        5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______")
        6. Make the word "favorite" italicized
        7. Make an image tag with the src attribute linked to a picture of yourself or of a placeholder image. Make sure you make an alt attribute too!
        8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me"
        9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. You will need to do a search for this text - it is long!
        10. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects"
        11. Create an unordered list with 3 list items that say "Project 1", "Project 2", and "Project 3"
        12. Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me" as text
        13. Create a paragraph that contains a fake phone number, e.g., "Phone: (202) 555-1234"
        14. Create a link tag (<a>) with a direction to mail to a fake email address. This is done by making a regular link, but in the href attribute, put mailto:fake@email.com (this opens up your email program with the TO field already filled out-try it!)

        BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early
          - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/)
          - In your contact me section, make the text "Phone:" and "Email:" bolded

          <p> My <em>favorite</em> thing about programming is the problem-solving aspect of organizing and typing ones code. It almost feels like a puzzle and I like to solve problems -- small or large.</p>

          <h3>About Me
          <p>Hello prospective reader, my name is Md Naveen Chowdhury and I am an aspiring software developer. I am currently 22 years old and am super excited to learn more about coding and 
            software development. I went to Vassar College for my under-grad pursuing a Political Science degree. Whilst that learning environment was fulfilling and enriching in many regards, 
            I found out that it truly was not for me. Learning to work with computers and designing my own work is very interesting, and I want to find different avenues where I can express myself through my 
            work. I am currently enrolled in the NYU SPS Software Development Intro Bootcamp and  this initial portfolio is an assignment for that class. I guess this first portfolio will provide
            myself with a template of what is to come forward -- hopefully some progress and better skills to decorate my portfolio. My end-goal for this bootcamp is to learn all the necessary skills 
            required in order to create and develop an app idea of my own; maybe that project in itself makes myself visible to employers at the end of the Extended Course bootcamp cycle. Fingers crossed. Logging out now. 
            Peace. 
          </p>
